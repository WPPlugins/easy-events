This is a easy event list management plugin, widget and shortcode which you can use to enter and display a programme of events.


== Description ==

This Plugin allows you to enter and manage different programmes of events that you then display in via a widget or shortcode.

This plugin requires bootstrap version 3.3.5 or higher to be included by the theme (i.e. it is not included by this plugin).

Installing is pretty easy takes only a minute or two.

1. Upload 'easy-events' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

4. Add this widget, to your themes widget display areas, select a title and click Save.
